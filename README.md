# How to compile & Deploy
The project is using Typescript as main language everything else (dependencies) is already included.

## Compilation
The first step will be to compile the typescript code into javascript code so browsers will be able to understand it. 
You also need to build some files that are dynamically generated like the manifest ...
This task is doable with :
```
npm install
nodejs ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --project tsconfig.json
nodejs build.js
```
The first task install dependencies (typescript) and the text one compile the typescript code.
We are using a custom tsconfig file which is optimized for production.

## Deploy
All the content of the src directory needs to be exposed with a web-server.

## Change configuration
You will have to edit the file src/config.ts in order to change the API endpoint. 

That's all
